# Spring Boot README

This is a README file for a Spring Boot project. It provides a brief overview of Spring Boot, getting started instructions, and common development tasks.

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is an open-source framework for rapid application development on top of the Java platform. It provides a convenient way to create production-grade Spring applications with minimal configuration. Spring Boot takes care of much of the boilerplate configuration typically needed for a Spring application, allowing you to focus on writing business logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 17 or later (check with `java -version`)
* Maven or Gradle (build tools)

### Creating a Spring Boot Application

The easiest way to create a Spring Boot application is to use the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/). This web tool allows you to choose the dependencies you need for your project and generates a project structure with the necessary configuration files.

Once you have generated your project, you can import it into your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA) and start developing your application.

### Running a Spring Boot Application

Spring Boot applications are typically packaged as executable JAR files. You can run your application from the command line using the following command:

```bash
java -jar my-app.jar
